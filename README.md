# 🎯 Objective
To create a reliable voltage stabilizer that ensures stable output voltage despite input fluctuations.

# ⚙️ Working Principle

The stabilizer works on the principle of:
The stabilizer operates based on:
- **Voltage Sensing:** The input voltage is sensed using a voltage sensor connected to the microcontroller.
- **Comparison with Desired Voltage:** The microcontroller compares the input voltage with the desired voltage level.
- **Deviation Adjustment:** If the input voltage deviates from the desired level, the microcontroller adjusts the input voltage to the required level.
- **Regulated Output:** The output voltage is maintained within safe limits.



# Features

 Detects voltage fluctuations (under-voltage or over-voltage)
 
 Protects connected appliances from electrical damage
   
 Compact and cost-effective design
